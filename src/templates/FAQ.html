                There are no guarantees with psychotherapy or psychiatry. We work in this field because we have seen
                people achieve

                be helped,
                but if what you need is something that we can help with then we will use the best available treatments
                to do

                No, medical diagnoses for depression can only be assessed by a healthcare professional. You can identify
                aspects of
                depression within yourself (e.g. feeling down and hopeless, having a hard time concentrating, a
                noticeable decrease
                in your energy level, thoughts of death or suicide, etc.), and all of these concerns should be addressed
                with your
                therapist so they can better identify the correct diagnosis and treatment plan for you.
